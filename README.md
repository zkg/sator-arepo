This is a dictionary based word square generator inspired on the Sator Square. 
The word squares produced by this program do not respect the 4-way palindrome 
of the famous Sator Arepo square, but they are two dimensional. In other words 
you can read the square from top-to-bottom and from left to right.

###Installation:

Make sure to specify a good dictionary in the config section or simply use the one provided.
